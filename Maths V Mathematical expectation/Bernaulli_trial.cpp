Bernaulli trial:

An experiment is called Bernaulli trial if has exactly two outcomes , one of which is desired.

Example,
Flipping a coin
Rolling a dice to get 4
Success / Failure

Theorem 1>
If probability of success of Bernaulli trial is p then the expected number of trials to get success
is 1 / p.

For example, Expected number of trials for rolling a dice to get 4:

Let E(x) = x,
E(x) = 1/6 + 5/6 * (1 + x)
x = 6

Alternatively , from Theorem 1 , probability of success is 1 / 6 so expected number of trials to
get success is 6. 

Theorem 2>
If probability of getting a success in Bernaulli trial is p then expected number of successes in n
trials is np. 

For example , n students are asked to choose a number from 1 to 100 inclusive. what is the expected
number of students that would choose single digit number.

Probability of success is 9/100 so expected number of success (expected number of students that would choose 
single digit number) is 9/100 * n.
