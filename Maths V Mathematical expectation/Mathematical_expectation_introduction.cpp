Mathematical Expectation :
It is defined as the average value of a random variable

Random variable:
1> Discrete and 2> Continuous 
   Dice            Temperature

Expectation of random variable can be written as:
E(X) = summation (pi * xi) 

In case of dice throw:
x = {1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6}

Expected value when a dice is thrown:
E(x) = 1 * 1/6 + 2 * 1 / 6 + ... + 6 * 1 / 6
E(x) = 3.5 

E(x) != most probable value

In case of temperature distribution:
E(x) = area under curve = integeration of p(x) * x * dx

Rules of Expectation of linearity:

Expected value of sum of two random variables is equal to the sum of their individual expected value
regardless they are independent or not

E(x + y) = E(x) + E(y)

special case:
E(ax + by) = a * E(x) + b * E(y)


For example, 
Expected value of sum of two random variables of two dice thrown simultaneously:
It can be calculated as summation over 1 / 6 * 1 / 6 * (sum) and there will be 36 outcomes

This can be solved also as,
E(x + y) = 3.5 + 3.5 = 7 	=> x and y are independent here

Let A denotes expected value of sum of random variables x and y and B denotes expected value
of product of random variable.

so ,

E(A + B) = E(A) + E(B) = 7 + (3.5 * 3.5) = 19.25 	=> A and B are dependent here
