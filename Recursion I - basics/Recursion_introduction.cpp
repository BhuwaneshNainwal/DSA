1> Recursion in computer science is method where solution to a problem depends on the solution to smaller
instances of the same problem

2> Eeasiest way to approach recursion problems,
Apply "Magical recursion rule" = Principal of mathematical inducction (PMI),

a> Figure out the base case.
b> Assume subproblems can be solved by recursion (automatically).
c> Using the subproblem write the answer for the current problem.
