1> Matrix multiplication is multiplying two matrices.

2> To multiply M1(r1 * c1) and M2(r2 * c2) ; c1 = r2
After multiplication let the matrix be C(r1 * c2).

3> Cost of multiplying elements r1 * r2 * c2.

4> Matrix chain multiplication is multiplying a number of matrices with minimum cost of multiplication.
