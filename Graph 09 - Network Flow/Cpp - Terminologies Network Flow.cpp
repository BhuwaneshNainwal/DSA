Terminologies regarding Network Flow:

1> Capacity => Flow is the exact amount of material that flows through edge and Capacity is the maximum amount of material that
can flow through edge.
flow(f) <= Capacity

2> Residual capacity => Total Capacity - flow of material

3> Augmented path => A path from source to sink such that residual capacity on every edge is greater than zero.

4> Maximum flow is the minimum weighted edge in an Augmented path.
