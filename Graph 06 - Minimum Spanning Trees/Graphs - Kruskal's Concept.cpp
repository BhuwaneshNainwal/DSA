Spanning tree:

1> Spanning tree is defined for undirected weighted graphs.

2> Spanning tree of a graph is the tree having all the vertices V and V - 1 edges.

3> Minimum spanning tree is a spanning tree made with lowest cost of edges.

4> Greedy algorithm because local optimum / minima leads to global optimum / minima.

Kruskal's algorithm:

1> Sort the edges based upon their weight value.

2> Using DSU to check if combining two node generates a cycle or not and combine them based upon that.
