	Binary operators :

	&  =>  gives 1 at a position only if bits at that position of both the operands is also 1.
	
	|  =>  gives 1 at a position only if bits at that position of at least one of the operands is also 1.

	^  =>  gives 1 at a position only if bits at that position of both the operands are opposite to each other.
 	
 	~  =>  flip all the bits of a number.

 	p << q  =>  multiplication of p by pow(2 , q) or shifting all the bits of p by q towards left.

 	p >> q  =>  division of p by pow(2 , q) or shifting all the bits of p by q towards right.
